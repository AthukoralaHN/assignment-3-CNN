 Hansaka P.V.A. - 220210P
 contribution : Set up the development environment, prepared the dataset, and designed the initial CNN architecture. Determined key parameters such as activation functions, kernel sizes, and dropout rate.
 
 Gunarathna A.S.M.K.B.  -  220184L 
 contribution : Trained the CNN model, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated different optimizers (SGD, Momentum). Conducted performance comparisons and analysis.

 Gunathilaka M.D.L.B.  -  220198H
 contribution : Investigated the effect of the momentum parameter, evaluated model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall), and documented results.
 
 Athukorala H.N. -  220050A
 contribution : Implemented transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG), fine-tuned models for the dataset, and recorded performance metrics.

 All Members collaboratively compared custom and pre-trained models, discussed trade-offs, advantages, and limitations.
